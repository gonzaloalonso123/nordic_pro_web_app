# Realtime Chat Future Improvements

## Current State
The current `useRealtimeChat.ts` hook is intentionally simple and functional. It handles basic realtime subscriptions without complexity.

## Potential Improvements (Future)

### 1. Simple Connection Status
Add basic connection state without over-engineering:
```ts
// Return simple status
return {
  isConnected: boolean,
  hasError: boolean
}
```

### 2. Basic Reconnection Logic
Add minimal retry logic without exponential backoff complexity:
```ts
// Simple retry on disconnect
const retryConnection = () => {
  if (retryCount < 3) {
    setTimeout(() => setupChannel(), 2000)
  }
}
```

### 3. Error Boundary Integration
Handle subscription errors gracefully:
```ts
channel.subscribe((status, err) => {
  if (status === 'CHANNEL_ERROR') {
    console.warn('Realtime connection lost, retrying...')
    retryConnection()
  }
})
```

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Debounce rapid reconnection attempts
- Use stable channel names to avoid unnecessary re-subscriptions
- Add cleanup on component unmount

## Design Principles
- **Keep it simple**: Avoid refs, complex state machines, and over-engineering
- **Progressive enhancement**: Add features only when needed
- **Maintainable**: Code should be readable and easy to debug
- **Production ready**: Handle common failure cases without complexity

## Implementation Guidelines
- Maximum 50 lines of code
- No more than 2-3 pieces of state
- Clear, descriptive variable names
- Focus on the 80/20 rule - handle common cases well
