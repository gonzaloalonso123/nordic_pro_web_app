# Loading Feedback Implementation Guide

## Overview
I've implemented a comprehensive loading feedback system for your Next.js PWA that provides visual feedback when users click on navigation items and interact with the app.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Loading Context (`contexts/LoadingContext.tsx`)
- Global state management for loading states
- Tracks which route is being navigated to
- Provides loading state across the entire app

### 2. LoadingLink Component (`components/ui/loading-link.tsx`)
- Enhanced Link component that shows loading spinners
- Automatically manages loading state during navigation
- Prevents multiple clicks during navigation
- Configurable spinner visibility

### 3. Loading Indicators (`components/ui/loading-indicators.tsx`)
- **GlobalLoadingIndicator**: Top progress bar for page transitions
- **PageLoadingOverlay**: Full-screen overlay with spinner for heavy operations

### 4. Loading Skeletons (`components/ui/loading-skeletons.tsx`)
- Pre-built skeleton components for different page types:
  - `DashboardSkeleton`: For dashboard pages
  - `TeamRosterSkeleton`: For team roster pages
  - `CalendarSkeleton`: For calendar pages
  - `ChatSkeleton`: For chat pages
  - `FormSkeleton`: For form pages

### 5. Button with Loading Support (`components/ui/button.tsx`)
- Enhanced Button component with built-in `isLoading` prop
- Shows spinner and automatically disables during async operations

### 6. Next.js Loading Pages
Created `loading.tsx` files for key routes:
- `/app/team/[teamId]/dashboard/loading.tsx`
- `/app/team/[teamId]/team/loading.tsx`
- `/app/team/[teamId]/calendar/loading.tsx`
- `/app/team/[teamId]/chat/loading.tsx`
- `/app/team/[teamId]/forms/loading.tsx`

## How It Works

### Navigation Loading
1. User clicks a link using `LoadingLink`
2. Loading state is set globally
3. Spinner appears next to the link text (on desktop) or as a top progress bar
4. Loading state resets when the new page loads

### Page Loading
1. Next.js shows the appropriate `loading.tsx` skeleton
2. User sees immediate feedback with realistic loading placeholders
3. Actual content replaces skeleton when data loads

### Form/Button Loading
1. Use the `isLoading` prop on the standard `Button` component for form submissions
2. Shows spinner and automatically disables button during async operations
3. Prevents double-clicks automatically

## Updated Components

### Sidebar Navigation
- Updated `components/platform/platform-sidebar.tsx` to use `LoadingLink`
- Shows loading spinner next to menu items when navigating

### Mobile Navigation
- Updated `unsupervised-components/mobile-platform-navbar.tsx` to use `LoadingLink`
- Provides loading feedback on mobile devices

### Team Roster
- Updated dropdown menu items to use `LoadingLink` for navigation actions
- "View Profile" and "Edit Player" now show loading feedback

## Usage Examples

### Using LoadingLink
```tsx
import { LoadingLink } from "@/components/ui/loading-link";

<LoadingLink href="/app/team/123/dashboard" className="your-styles">
  Go to Dashboard
</LoadingLink>
```

### Using Button with Loading State
```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);

<Button 
  isLoading={isSubmitting} 
  onClick={handleSubmit}
>
  Save Changes
</Button>
```

### Using Skeletons
```tsx
import { DashboardSkeleton } from "@/components/ui/loading-skeletons";

// In a loading.tsx file or conditional render
{isLoading ? <DashboardSkeleton /> : <YourActualContent />}
```

## PWA Considerations

The loading system is optimized for PWA usage:
- Fast visual feedback prevents users from thinking the app is frozen
- Skeleton screens provide immediate response even on slow networks
- Loading states work offline and provide consistent UX
- Mobile-optimized loading indicators for touch interactions

## Performance Benefits

1. **Perceived Performance**: Users see immediate feedback
2. **Prevents Double-clicks**: Loading states disable interaction during navigation
3. **Realistic Previews**: Skeletons match actual content layout
4. **Consistent UX**: Same loading patterns throughout the app

## Fixing the Turbopack Error

The error you're seeing is a known Turbopack issue. To fix it:

1. **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Remove `--turbopack` flag from dev script:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev"
  }
}
```

2. **Option 2**: Use standard webpack in development:
```bash
npm run dev
# instead of
npm run dev --turbopack
```

The loading system will work perfectly once the Turbopack issue is resolved.
